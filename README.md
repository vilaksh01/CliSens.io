# CliSensio
CliSensio - Climate Sensing and Insect Infestation Control is a new adaptive device which runs SensiML AutoML audio recognition on the edge to recognize disease spreading vectors, hungry pests and threatful species. CliSensio device firmware can be flashed for mosquito species identification, pest identifications and elimination response or both in near future.

Singapore launched a comprehensive nationwide programme in 1968 targeting the Aedes mosquito, the main mosquito vector of dengue. However, dengue and Zika has still remain an endemic for Singaporeans and routine fogging is not a sustainable vector control measure because:
1. The fogging chemical has to come into direct contact with the mosquitoes to kill them
2. The overuse or indiscriminate use of chemical treatment may increase the resistance of the local mosquito population.
3. Fogging just a single area may also chase mosquitoes to another location.
The key strategy for dengue and Zika control is source eradication, which is to detect and remove breeding habitats and larvae. 

In Singapore, where mosquito-borne dengue is endemic, the country experienced its largest dengue outbreak to date in 2020, with over 35,000 people infected and at least 29 deaths. Read more from Asian Scientist Magazine at: https://lnkd.in/ekMQvtD

Learn how our solution, CliSensio is here to stay for a long time than fogging guns.
Firstly, CliSensio run advanced ML algorithms to detects mosquitoes sex, breed and population based upon wingbeat frequency and audio classification.
Secondly, it reports the classification over cellular, Lora networks to government agencies and household representatives.
Thirdly, to control the sudden outbreak CliSensio has eradication method to activate chemical atomizer which is more effective for a breeding ground to kill egg laying mosquitoes and their habit without human intervention.

Imagine a swarm of such CliSensio devices in locality to prevent such endemics and provide insights to governments for houses, where the authorities cannot go easily or frequently to check on them. Read about our device features here: https://lnkd.in/eQBUXuQ
