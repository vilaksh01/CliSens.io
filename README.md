# CliSensio
CliSensio - Climate Sensing and Insect Infestation Control is a new adaptive device which runs SensiML AutoML audio recognition on the edge to recognize disease spreading vectors, hungry pests and threatful species. CliSensio device firmware can be flashed for mosquito species identification, pest identifications and elimination response or both in near future.
